<p>the left speaker is at 0 radians and the right speaker is at π radians, giving us a panning range of θ ∈ [0; π], with the center position at θ = π.<br>linear panning: L(θ) + R(θ) = 1.<br>耳朵垂直线和左边的夹角是θ，linear的算法是，左边（pi/2 - θ) * 2/pi<br>右边 θ ＊ 2 ／ pi</p>
<ol>
<li>What is constant power panning? Why would you use constant power panning? With constant power panning, if a sound has an amplitude of 1 when panned full left, what amplitude do you send to both speakers when panning to the center?<br>L(θ) = cos(θ) and R(θ) = sin(θ)<br>One way of dealing with the ”hole-in-the-middle” effect is to use constant power panning. Basically, we exchange the linear function for L(θ) and R(θ) with the sine and cosine functions, such that L(θ) = cos(θ) and R(θ) = sin(θ).<br>Main idea: power is proportional to the squared amplitude, and cos2 + sin2 = 1, thus L(θ) = cos(θ) and R(θ) = sin(θ) yields constant power panning.<br>pan full left angle = 0</li>
</ol>
<p>In such a case, if the listener is always placed at the sweet-spot, and facing the speakers, the hole-in-the-middle effect may not be very significant. However, if the speakers are placed far from each other in a big room, then the phases</p>

<li><p>What is frequency masking? Explain the roll of frequency masking in MP3 music compression.<br>Using ear as filter bank. loud sound in a channel masks soft sound in adjacent channels.<br>hide equalization effects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You should be familiar with the steps of MP3 encoding. E.g. what is the purpose of Huffman Coding in MP3?1<br>Why does MP3 encode music using a frequency-based representation rather than a time-based one?<br>step 1: filter bank(32 bands of equal width)<br>step 2: psychoacoustic model(Take 1024 point FFT of audio, group spectrum into critical bands;Identify tonal components (sinusoids) and assign tonal index to each critical band )<br>huffman:  removing coding redundancy: Gives smallest number of code symbols per source symbol.<br>this allows more efficient coding. apply filters because in time domain we can’t view frequency directly. it’s good to transfer continuous data into discrete data.</p>

<li><p>Suppose you are concerned about quantization noise using an 8-bit DAC. What is the improvement in S/N ratio if you upgrade to a 12-bit DAC (assume perfect, noise-free analog circuits)?<br>4 * 6 = 24dB</p>

<li><p>Why do many telephone systems use (8-bit) μLaw rather than 8-bit PCM? Explain an advantage of μLaw over PCM and an advantage of PCM over μLaw.<br>a. scaled to span 13 bit dynamic range. a large range for representation.<br>b. because ulaw is logarithmic. there are more codes for near-zero amplitudes than high amplitude, while pcm is linear, more equally distributed.</p>

<li>In Linear Panning between 2 speakers, a value α, between 0 and 1, is the portion of the sound coming from the left speaker, and (1- α) is the portion of the sound coming from the right speaker. What is the main problem with using Linear Panning to make a sound “move” from left to right (or vice versa)?<br>a. Mid-range frequencies are attenuated<br>b. It’ s electronically hard to implement<br>c. The power of the signal changes with α, so the perceived loudness of the sound<br>varies with pan position<br>d.
